# TODO

## Make the CPU cycle-accurate
Make the cycle timing of all instructions match the real chip.

See these links:
* [this link](http://6502.org/tutorials/65c02opcodes.html).
* [here](https://floooh.github.io/2019/12/13/cycle-stepped-6502.html).
* [Here](http://atarihq.com/danb/files/64doc.txt) is another link.

## Other stuff
* Implement a floating point co-processor (where did the link go?)
